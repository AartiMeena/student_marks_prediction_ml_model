# student_marks_prediction_ml_model

This is a Machine learning model.I use linear regression algorithm . It predicts the marks of student that if you study x hours then you can get y% marks.

#Accuracy score
95.14%

I created a student marks prediction model with the help of following few steps like :

1. Define project objectives
2. Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning , Data Preparation , split into train and test , Feature Scaling).
3. Model Selection
4. Data Collection
5. Data Visualization
6. Model Building
7. Deploy Model
